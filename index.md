This lesson aims to introduce the use of Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s or K-ate-s, with the goal of using Kubernetes to enable reproducible computational environments at scale.

The hands-on work in this lesson is aimed to using Kubernetes on your own laptop. These concepts can be translated to other Kubernetes environments, including those provided by a single compute nodes, campus Kubernetes cluster, large scale national clusters, or cloud providers.
