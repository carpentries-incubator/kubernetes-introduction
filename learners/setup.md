## Software Setup

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: discussion

### Details

This lesson is designed around having access to a campus or regional Kubernetes resource. If one is not available, you can create a local one on your computer using a tool called [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io). To use this tool, please visit the [setup guide for MiniKube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start).

If you have access to a campus or regional platform, please reach out to the support staff of the platform for getting access. As a part of a workshop, this should be handled for you. 


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

To access and interact with the resources, you will need a command line tool called `kubectl`. Instructions on how to install this for your specific operating system are available at [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl)
